                This collection celebrates the powerful musical traditions born from the African American experience—from spirituals that sustained enslaved people through unimaginable hardship, to work songs that made backbreaking labor bearable, to protest anthems that fueled the abolitionist and civil rights movements. These songs represent hope, resilience, dignity, and the enduring human spirit.
