Pat's Musical Style and Compatible Song Suggestions
---------------------------------------------------

ðŸŽ¸ Your Style:

- Fingerpicking:
  â€¢ Clean, steady, melodic fingerstyleâ€”more folk/traditional than bluesy.
  â€¢ Supports the vocal without competingâ€”rhythmically solid and gentle.

- Vocals:
  â€¢ Honest, unforced deliveryâ€”warm and storyteller-like.
  â€¢ Comfortable mid-range; expressive and sincere.
  â€¢ Strongest when the lyrics are vivid or quirky, not abstract or theatrical.

- Tempo & Mood:
  â€¢ Moderate to slow pacing feels natural.
  â€¢ Wistful, nostalgic, and lightly humorous songs work well.
  â€¢ You shine on emotionally rich, narrative-driven songs.
