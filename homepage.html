<h1>Folksong Collection</h1>

<p>
A <em>song carrier</em> is someone who learns, preserves, and passes along traditional songs—especially those that might otherwise fade from memory. The phrase is often associated with oral tradition, where songs are transmitted from person to person rather than through written music or recordings. In that tradition, this is an archive of traditional folk songs and ballads, including historical information and audio recordings.
</p>

<p>
If you have found this site years from now as family, you don’t need to listen to everything or understand the history. These are songs I lived with for a long time. Wander, sample, skip around. If one or two songs stick, that’s enough.
</p>

<p>
These are old folk songs, children’s songs, and ballads recorded with simple guitar and vocals. A line in <em>Yankee Doodle Dandy</em> says “mind the music and the step.” For the most part, the melodies are true to the originals.
</p>

<p>
The voice and guitar are rough—recorded by an old man on the back porch of a cabin in the woods. Still, if you are wondering how some of these old songs go, this will give you a hint.
</p>

<p>
If you’re not sure where to begin, try a small playlist, select songs at random, or start with a short <strong>Start Here</strong> list. The songs were never meant to be taken in order.
</p>

<h2>Site Navigation</h2>

<p>
Select songs from any of the playlists. Press “Play.” This will add selected songs to the audio player. When you select new songs from one of the playlists, the previous playlist is automatically cleared from the audio player.
</p>

<p>
To add songs to the audio player from more than one playlist, use the “All Tracks” list. You can search for songs from this list by title or author. You can also select songs at random.
</p>

<p>
You can send an email of a few selected songs to others by pressing the “Share” button. The email text has a 2,000-character limit, so only try to send a few songs at a time.
